## The Good

### 1. The accommodation in Bali is outstanding

We loved staying in traditional Balinese-style guest houses and villas—although I am still unsure of the difference between the two. The grass-roof bamboo stilt house in Amlapura was an exceptional delight, despite its lack of strong lights, cooling, or … walls. The outdoor bathrooms were all stylish, plant-filled, and a strangely fun experience. (Yes, I know, I have a thing for them). Lush nature, water, and various deities are omnipresent in all gardens, and for two atheists, we quite enjoyed the statues, small temples and offerings put out everywhere. Balinese architecture’s colours, materials, and overall atmosphere are so full of joyful calm and balance that we would like to replicate it at home if we can.


### 2. The beaches are beautiful

Rocky or sandy, the black volcanic beaches of Bali have a peculiar feel. We walked on unusually sparkly fine black sand in Pulukum with nobody else on the vast beach, watching small crabs roll the sand in tiny round balls to build city-like avenues. We watched locals extract salt from black mud on Amed beach, search for fish bait under black rocks polished to perfection by the waves in Amlapura, or collect clams in the corral-filled shallows for soup in Lovina. Each beach was different but equally humbling in its majestic beauty.


### 3. The Balinese locals are wonderful people.

No matter where we went, the locals were welcoming, friendly, smiling, and helpful, and they did not expect any benefit in exchange. We heard stories from our hosts about how they came to run a guest house (that started as an orphanage in Amlapura) and how they survived farming onions during the pandemic while tourists stayed away (at Lake Batur). In Lovina, our hosts started the day at 6 am to make us coffees so that we could go out on a boat tour fully awake. In Canggu, the guest house staff reorganised their work to let us stay way past check-out time so that we have somewhere comfortable to spend the day until our late flight back home. Locals ran to pick me up when I fell off my bike and helped us find our way after the navigator took us down a bad road in the mountains.


### 4. Mountain twisties. If you’re a motorcyclist, you’ll know what I mean.

Everyone goes to Bali for the beaches or sights, but motorcyclists will understand this: the twisties were the biggest source of excitement for us. Yelling ‘woo-hoo’ or ‘wheeee’, and singing our silly happy-riding songs, are the sign of a good trip. The mountain roads of Bali go through gorgeous forests, offer the most amazing ocean views I have ever seen, have countless tight corners and are occasionally so steep that you wonder whether your engine or brakes will hold through. The kind of roads that make us ride.


### 5. Getting lost is as rewarding as finding our way.

The same mountain roads (and a Tardis-like navigator that doesn’t always take you where you want to be but does take you where you need to be) are also the source of another experience we treasure: that of getting lost and discovering places and riding skills that we did not know before. For people that are a bit OCD about planning (David) (Ed., Yeah, I’m OCD.) and organising (Dalma), we enjoy the uncertainty of not knowing where we go next and of having no idea where we are. Getting lost is part of the freedom of riding.


### 6. The food, the food, the food.

This is an obvious one, but it still needs to be mentioned. For two weeks, we only ate Indonesian food. Mostly Balinese, some Javanese, and only on the rare occasion, some Western fusion if there was nothing else available. The Kopi Bali (Balinese coffee) is thick, black, and so strong that it would wake the dead. The Sambal Matah is a Balinese onion-chili-lemongrass-lime-garlic sauce that comes as a small side to many dishes and leaves your taste-buds tingling. The local fresh fish, char-grilled with spices, is delicious, regardless of where you get it. The weird fruit that we bought because we thought the seller called it “snack fruit”, but it turned out to be “snake fruit”, and we had no idea of the taste until we put it in our mouths. The fruit platters full of colourful fresh fruit are omnipresent on menus as a breakfast side or dessert. Speaking of which, our discovery of Lak-Lak will likely lead to some home attempts in making these tiny rice-flour pancakes with palm sugar and coconut as a reminder of a happy holiday.


## The low-lights

### 1. The traffic is confronting on a motorcycle.

Bali, like many Asian destinations, is notorious for its terrible traffic. Denpasar and Ubud were a scary start to someone expecting everyone to follow coherent road rules, but you learn fast with no other choice than going with it. We were lucky that Canggu was the last stop of our trip and our skills were ninja level by then (well, beginning ninja); otherwise, there would have been a tragic end to the holiday. Cars and bikes seem to operate on one principle: push your way, and the flow will take you in. Trucks will use up the street width, and bikes will take the gaps between them and the footpath (or possibly take the footpath) if needed. There will be four or five vehicles next to each other in one lane, not all going in the same direction. Scooters will consider half a meter a comfortable width for overtaking, and intersections can look like an angry beehive, with cars and bikes crisscrossing in slow (fast) motion. Not for the faint-hearted, but a very effective training for riding skills you would never learn in Australia.


### 2. Canggu is ugly (at least in 2022)

This place deserves its own ‘recognition’ on our list for the traffic, the crowd, the state of its roads and lack of sidewalks, the polluted air, and so on. Every aspect you would expect a city that wants to attract tourists should develop and care for, Canggu handles with amazing failure. Nevertheless, plenty of tourists seem to choose Canggu for long-term stays due to its low prices. Not a place we ever plan to visit again.

### 3. Garbage spoils the natural beauty.

It is heartbreaking to see the natural beauty of Bali choked by roadside garbage. Not everywhere, but too often for it not to be a systemic issue, garbage is left everywhere or occasionally simply burned on the roadside with suffocating fumes. We could only presume that garbage collection is unavailable in the mountains, where villages are hard to be reached via long and difficult roads, but it also seems to be a cultural issue. On an early morning boat trip out to the open waters to see some dolphins, the boat passed a tied, full plastic garbage bag that was likely washed in by the tide. The bag was floating on the ocean, a few hundred meters from the shore, but our guide (skipper) ignored it. It will take a radical cultural shift for Bali to develop a cleaner environment.

### 4. The heat and humidity are draining.

Our visit was in the high season, in relatively dry weather and with a nice ocean breeze. We copped some serious rain in Ubud, both once we left that area, we were dry and enjoyed the wind through our mesh jackets. We even got cold weather up in the mountains. However, as soon as we had to stop while riding in full gear or walking anywhere out of the sea breeze, the hot and humid air hit us hard. This was particularly bad in slow-moving traffic, but even visiting some attractions. We used up a copious amount of sunscreen, sweated out our body weight, and had to regularly stop to rehydrate before passing out.


### 5. We hated that it came to an end.

Despite all the uncomfortable or unpleasant aspects, the worse of these two weeks was that they ended. The pros vastly outweigh the cons, and we wish we could stay longer (not in Canggu) or better yet, move on riding through the rest of Asia. One day.
